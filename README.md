# flutter-commands README

This extension can run commonly used flutter commands from the command palette/activity bar. I don't think it will be useful to anyone since this is only a test on how to create an extension

## Features

Flutter APK Build:In Parts - will build different files for different ABI(Application Binary Interface)  
Flutter APK Build:Fat - will build a single fat apk file in release mode  
Flutter Repair Import Errors - Deletes the package file and runs pub get command  
Flutter Repair Project - Runs flutter clean and flutter create .  

## Requirements

You must have Flutter and Dart installed previously
