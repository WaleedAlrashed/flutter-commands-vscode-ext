# flutter-commands README

This extension can run commonly use flutter commands from the command pallete. I don't think it will be helpful as this is only a test on how to create an extension

## Features

Flutter APK Build:In Parts - will build different files for different ABI(Application Binary Interface)
Flutter APK Build:Fat - will build a single fat apk file in release mode
Flutter Repair Import Errors - Deletes the package file and runs pub get command

## Requirements

You must have Flutter and Dart installed previously


## Known Issues

Nothing so far since this is only a test

## Release Notes

Initial release of the extension with a single command

**Enjoy!**
